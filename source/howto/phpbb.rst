To run the `phpBB <https://www.phpbb.com>`_ bulletin board using Unit:

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_install_unit.rst

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_install_prereq.rst

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_install_app.rst

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_change_ownership.rst

#. Next, prepare the app :ref:`configuration <configuration-php>` for Unit (use
   real values for :samp:`share` and :samp:`root`):

   .. note::

      The difference between the :samp:`pass` targets is their usage of the
      :samp:`script` :ref:`setting <configuration-php>`:

      - The :samp:`direct` target runs the :samp:`.php` script from the URI or
        defaults to :samp:`index.php` if the URI omits it.

      - The :samp:`index` target specifies the :samp:`script` that Unit runs
        for *any* URIs the target receives.

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_upload_config.rst

   After a successful update, your app should be available on the listenerâ€™s IP
   address and port:

   .. image:: ../images/phpbb.png
      :width: 100%
      :alt: phpBB on Unit

#. Browse to :samp:`/install/app.php` to complete your installation.  Having
   done that, delete the :file:`install/` subdirectory to mitigate security
   risks:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ rm -rf :nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`install/
